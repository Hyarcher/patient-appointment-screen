## How to install and run the application.

Extract the Zip.

Open a command line application.

Using 'cd', locate the directory;

```
cd Waiting-room-notice-board-master
```

Then the user should be in the directory.
If so then type;

```
npm install
```
This will install the node modules required for the application to run correctly.

Now the server can be started by using the following code;

```
